    <title>HTML Nesting (Starter): Grouping Headings and Paragraphs</title>

    <!--
      STARTER VERSION (HTML-ONLY)
      --------------------------
      Goal: This file is meant for students to read + edit.

      Rules for this starter file:
      - No CSS (<style>) and no JavaScript (<script>)
      - Use semantic HTML and clear comments
      - Keep examples short and focused

      Lesson focus:
      - Why do we nest (group) content such as headings and paragraphs?

      Real-world idea:
      - A website is made of grouped parts (sections):
        "Top Stories", "Announcements", "Contact", etc.
      - Grouping makes it easier to understand, style, and update.

      <h1>HTML Nesting (Starter)</h1>
      <p>
        This page teaches why we <strong>nest</strong> (group) related content in
        real websites.
      </p>

      <!--
        Tip:
        - Right-click → View Page Source to see the raw HTML.
        - Notice how indentation helps humans see nesting.

           1) WHAT NESTING MEANS
           ========================================================== -->
      <section aria-labelledby="meaning-title">
        <h2 id="meaning-title">1) What does “nesting” mean?</h2>

        <!--
          Key idea:
          - Nesting means placing one element inside another element.

          Why we do it:
          - It shows relationships: what belongs together.

          Example:
          - A <section> groups content about ONE topic.
          - Inside it, we put the heading + paragraphs for that topic.
        -->

        <section aria-labelledby="shipping-title">
          <h3 id="shipping-title">Shipping Info (example group)</h3>
          <p>Orders arrive in 3–5 business days.</p>
          <p>Tracking is emailed after checkout.</p>
        </section>

        <!--
          Notice:
          - The <h3> and <p> tags are "inside" the group (the section).
          - That tells us those paragraphs belong to that shipping topic.
        -->
      </section>

           2) REAL-WORLD SCENARIO

      <section aria-labelledby="real-world-title">
        <h2 id="real-world-title">2) Real-world scenario: a simple homepage</h2>

        <!--
          Imagine a school news homepage.

          A real homepage often has grouped areas like:
          - Top Stories
          - Announcements
          - Contact

          We'll use:
          - <section> for each area (group)
          - <article> for each story (a standalone content item)
        -->

        <section aria-labelledby="top-stories-title">
          <h3 id="top-stories-title">Top Stories</h3>

          <!--
            Each <article> is one story.
            It has its own heading and supporting paragraph.
          -->
          <article aria-labelledby="story-1-title">
            <h4 id="story-1-title">New Library Hours</h4>
            <p>The library is now open until 7PM on weekdays.</p>
          </article>

          <article aria-labelledby="story-2-title">
            <h4 id="story-2-title">Intramurals Sign-Up</h4>
            <p>Join basketball or volleyball. Registration ends Friday.</p>
          </article>

          <!--
            Student task:
            - Add a THIRD <article> here.
            - Give it an <h4> title and a <p> description.
          -->
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="announcements-title">
          <h3 id="announcements-title">Announcements</h3>

           3) WHY GROUPING HELPS
           ========================================================== -->
      <section aria-labelledby="why-title">
        <h2 id="why-title">3) Why grouping is useful (in real websites)</h2>

        <!--
          Students often ask:
          "Why not just write headings and paragraphs in a row?"

          You CAN do that, but grouping helps:
          1) Readability: You can see what belongs together.
          2) Styling: You can style one area without affecting another.
          3) Accessibility: Screen readers can navigate by sections/headings.
          4) Maintenance: It's easier to move or delete a whole group.
        -->

        <h3>Ungrouped (flat) example</h3>
        <!--
          Problem:
          - It's harder to see which paragraphs belong to which heading.
          - It is harder to move one "topic" as a single unit.
        -->
        <h4>Top Stories</h4>

        <p>Join basketball or volleyball. Registration ends Friday.</p>

        <h3>Grouped (nested) example</h3>
        <!--
          Better:
          - One <section> groups everything about Top Stories.
          - Each story is its own <article>.

        Practice:
        Try creating a new group called <strong>Events</strong> using
        <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, then add 2 <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
        items inside it.
